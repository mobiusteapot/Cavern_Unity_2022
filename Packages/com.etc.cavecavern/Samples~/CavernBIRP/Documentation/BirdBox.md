# Bird Box
The bird box is a sample prefab to test spatial audio with the 4 speakers and one subwoofer of the cavern. By default, it will rotate from the bottom right over to the bottom left.

# Modes

The birdbox manager mode can be cycled through at runtime to change which device the bird box should align with, to test specific speakers. There should be some minimal sound bleed to other speakers.

# Controls

Use the number pad values 1, 3, 7, and 9 to change the corner, and 5 to toggle if the birdbox should auto rotate. Pressing Ctrl + a number should move the audio listener exactly inside the bird box, which was useful for testing at one point and time but maybe is no longer needed.
