# Welcome to the Cavern!

# Template
This template has a working version of the single and multi camera Cavern rigs. You should experiment with both and see which one is right for the type of content you are looking to create.

# Debugging

There is a debug manager component (currently used to display the state of the sound test bird box in the editor). You can use this to print information to the screen in play mode in the editor, and the strings will not be included on build. This can be useful for testing, since it is not possible to read the debug log on runtime while previewing Cavern content.

# Run In Play Mode

Using the "Fullscreen" asset and preview, you can run the Cavern in Play Mode to iterate and quickly test specific features.
