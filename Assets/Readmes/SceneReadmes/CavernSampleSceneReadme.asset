    text: For this platform to be used to it's full potential, we need to export
      our frames very specifically for them to be 3D. There are a few rigs and projector
      settings to familarize yourself with.

  - heading: 3D Modes - Frame Sequential
    text: The projectors are capable of a few types of 3D. Older versions of the
      template use "Field Sequential", which requires the projectors recieve a 120hz
      display, which is split into 60hz per eye.. Unity broke this method in 2019.
      Newer versions export a combined frame the projectors split.
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 3D Modes - Frame Packed
    text: The projectors can be run at a higher resolution if the refresh rate is
      lower, and the image can be sent in one 60hz frame which is split in two, either
      on each side, or on the top and bottom, to be displayed one per eye.

  - heading: Cavern Rigs - Legacy
    text: The "Legacy" cavern rig uses 36 cameras which get stitched into a single
      render texture. These "sub cameras" are created on runtime and driven by the
      Cavern Legacy Controller.
